## What is HOT?

HOT is a high-performance, feature-complete in-memory caching library for Go applications. It provides:

- **Multiple Eviction Policies**: LRU, LFU, TinyLFU, W-TinyLFU, S3FIFO, ARC, 2Q, and FIFO algorithms
- **Advanced Features**: TTL with jitter, stale-while-revalidate, missing key caching
- **High Performance**: Nanosecond-precision timestamps, zero-allocation operations
- **Scalability**: Sharded architecture for high concurrency
- **Observability**: Built-in Prometheus metrics
- **Type Safety**: Go generics for compile-time guarantees

## Getting Started

```go
import "github.com/samber/hot"

// Create a simple LRU cache
cache := hot.NewHotCache[string, int](hot.LRU, 1000).
    WithTTL(5*time.Minute).
    Build()

// Use the cache
cache.Set("key", 42)
value, found, _ := cache.Get("key")
```

## Key Concepts

### Eviction Policies
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Evicts items that haven't been accessed recently
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Evicts items with the lowest access frequency
- **S3FIFO (Segmented 3-Level FIFO)**: An extension of FIFO with three segments to reduce cache pollution and better handle varying access patterns.
- **TinyLFU**: Uses a small, approximate frequency histogram to track item popularity and decide eviction efficiently.
- **W-TinyLFU (Windowed TinyLFU)**: Combines a small “window” cache with TinyLFU to handle both recency and frequency, improving hit rates.
- **ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache)**: Automatically adapts between LRU and LFU
- **2Q (Two Queue)**: Uses two queues to separate frequently and infrequently accessed items
- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Evicts items in the order they were added

### Cache Modes
- **Main Cache**: Stores actual data values
- **Missing Cache**: Stores negative results to prevent repeated lookups

### Performance Features
- **Sharding**: Reduces lock contention in high-concurrency scenarios
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk operations for better throughput
- **Copy-on-Read/Write**: Optional value copying for thread safety
